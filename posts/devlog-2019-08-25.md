We have been hard at work testing our MIDI color system in augmented reality, while still polishing the VR experience for our upcoming events. We were fortunate to host our session pianist Noah Suazo for our most recent test, to uncover the possibilities of augmented reality! This test was used with the LIV software, and it is a really incredible tool for mixed reality recording.
