I got to bring my VR/AR rig down to my university to demonstrate a VR conducting app I have been working on for a class, and couldn't help myself in sharing some Portraits stuff as well! Here is a short demonstration of the Portraits of Change beta software and AR prototype with the man who taught me piano, Greg Creager! The past year has been very challenging on all of us... I shifted gears, and started working on an educational tool to help teach basic conducting... With the pandemic soon recessing as we ramp up vaccinations, the prospect of live performance with live audiences becomes possible again. There will be a Portraits performance as my senior recital by the end of the year.
