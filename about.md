      <div class="space-y-4 text-lg text-gray-300">
        <p>I'm a musician, developer, and creative technologist. Hit me up if you want to collab, duel, barter, or talk about the existential enigma that is our times.
          Classically trained, electronically adopted and a jazz lover at heart, I produce, play trumpet and sing, but my passion lies in interdisciplinary creation. I love finding ways to understand music through the lens of other disciplines, from engineering to computer science, to biology and mathematics. This has led me to explore mixed reality and its applications in the arts, with the goal of exploring new paradigms in education and live performance.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-400">My work thrives under the umbrella of Complexity art, exploring this new form of science through the medium of music and light. I explore and critique dynamic systems and their representations. I am interested in emergence, from cellular automata to music improvisation. I am interested in ecology, economics, artificial intelligence, sociology, anthropology, and what these fields can do for music, and what music can do for these fields.</p>
